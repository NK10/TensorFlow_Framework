The most common framework for this is most likely the k-fold cross-validation. However, even for a testing procedure, we need to choose some (k) numbers of nodes.  \n",

We can calculate 8 different numbers to feed into our validation procedure and find the optimal model, based on the resulting validation loss.\n",
